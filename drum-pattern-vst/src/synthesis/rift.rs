//! Rift ([221]) — a percussion or FX carved out of a long texture.
//!
//! Every other voice in the plugin builds a sound from nothing. Rift instead
//! *lifts a slice* out of one of four embedded textures of several seconds
//! (`sample_bank::texture`), and shapes it with an amplitude envelope, a
//! resonant multi-mode filter and the shared saturation chain. The same
//! texture gives a shaker, a bell, a click or a riser depending on where the
//! slice is taken and how it is cut.
//!
//! The parameter that carries the instrument is **Offset**. Being a plain
//! continuous special parameter, it is p-lockable per step and morphable
//! across a fusion for free — sixteen cells of a page become sixteen different
//! samplings of the same matter, with no code of our own behind it.
//!
//! Retrigger follows the [179] contract: the read position, filter and DC
//! blocker all restart from a clean state, and `RetrigDeclick` (3 ms) absorbs
//! the discontinuity. There is deliberately no phase continuity here.
